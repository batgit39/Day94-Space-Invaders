# Day94-Space-Invaders
A remake of Space Invaders in Python-Turtle

Currently this game only has 1 level and the enemy can't shoot- the reason for that I tried to have them shoot nukes but they were just getting stuck at 1 position and the game was lagging a lot, this could be because of my code or python turtle can't handle so many requests at the same time.
